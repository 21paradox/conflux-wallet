    'FC is primarily designed for recognizing community contribution. The Conflux Foundation respects every contribution and guarantees transparency on the distribution of every pennyworth of FC. Members of the Conflux community in return are obliged to make every contribution a legal and positive effort in building the community.',

    'The Conflux Foundation issues FC on the promise of prioritizing the FC-CFX exchange services after the expiration of lock-up periods on Foundation’s ecosystem funds. Given that the current estimate launch day of Conflux main network is between 2019.Q4 – 2020.Q1, the FC-CFX exchange service will commence shortly after.',

    'Community members acquire FC from two sources, a. incentives from the Conflux Foundation and b. P2P Transaction. To motivate members to contribute more and obtain FC via the former, while to detain potentially malicious intents by the latter, Conflux Foundation makes special adjustment to the liquidity of FC so that FC obtained not directly from the Conflux Foundation is subject to a secondary allocation upon transfer, namely, a certain ratio of the transfer amount will be staked in order to initiate a transfer.',

    'Scenario 1:   Assume the current circulation ratio is 100, meaning for every 100 FCs transfer, an addition of 100 FCs will be permanently locked for transfer. Upon completing a Conflux bounty task, Alice receives 10 FCs from Conflux Foundation as our gratitude. Meanwhile, she also receives a transfer from Bob that worth of 10 FCs. At this point, Alice owns a total of 20 FCs, and she would like to transfer some FCs to Denise. Note that due to the Liquidity Principle, not all of the 20 FCs are available for her to transfer. To calculate the maximum available amount, Alice should first count all the FCs obtained directly from Conflux Foundation, which is 10 FCs, and next count only 100 / (100 + 100) = 50% of the rest of FCs, which is 5 FCs. As a result, Alice is able to transfer a maximum of 10 + 5 = 15 FCs to Denis.',
