To calculate the maximum available amount, Alice should first count all the FCs obtained directly from Conflux Foundation, which is 10 FCs, and next count only 100 / (100 + 100) = 50% of the rest of FCs, which is 5 FCs. As a result, Alice is able to transfer a maximum of 10 + 5 = 15 FCs to Denis.',
